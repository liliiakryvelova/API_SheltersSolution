## Description

* _You've completed a few projects at the dev agency where you work and you've been given more autonomy to choose which project you'd like to work on next. The agency currently has three new back-end contracts to build APIs for their clients. Since this is the first time you've been given free rein on a project, take this opportunity to showcase your versatility for the project manager._

* _Animal Shelter: Create an API for a local animal shelter. The API will list the available cats and dogs at the shelter._
* _Down the file you can find the example of implementation Swagger/OpenAPI. Swagger is a set of tools created to help with API developing and documentation process. OpenAPI refers to the industry-standardspecification for RESTful API design._
